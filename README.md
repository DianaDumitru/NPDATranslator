# NPDATranslator
Nondeterministic pushdown automata with Îµ-moves
Given the following info about a NPDA translator:
list of states, initial state, list of final states,
input alphabet, output alphabet, stack aplphabet, initial stack symbol,
and all the transitions, the program outputs the list of strings that the automata translates for an input string (read from console).
